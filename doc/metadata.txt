Need flexible meta data on documents to express:
Can we lift this off the other document store?
ownership
uploader
origination of document
status of document (signed, draft, etc.)
access rules / rights?
dates
date rangs
years

general tags:


conceptual question
- does the store govern the document, e.g. does it now what this is, or does the producing / consuming applciation need to know that?
-in other words: is there more information about the docs elsewhere, and therefore distributed, is this it?
- or is this totally dumb: just a filing cabinet without a brain.
- what does this look like in a document centric view of the process?
-- borrower provides documents
-- bank provides documents
-- underwriters create risk analysis and decision document
-- loan contract and schedule get signed
-- documents are pushed back and forth during collections.
- what does it look like in a data centric view of the process?
-- documents are just one way to capture data, but not the only way, so they are just another data set.
-- no need to make them more special than the other data in the system.
-- from a modelling perspective treat them just like any other piece of data
-- treat the document store just like a database / service.
